        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place <b>salmon</b> on cutting board, skin-side up, and cut into 6 portions. Using a sharp knife, make 3 1/8" deep cuts through skin of each portion.</li>
            <li>Whisk 1 tbsp <b>oil</b>, 2 tbsp <b>jerk seasoning</b>, <b>paprika</b>, and 1 tsp <b>lime juice</b> in medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Rub mixture on both sides of the salmon. Cover and refrigerate for about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Position racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 425Â°F.</li>
            <li>Toss <b>Brussel sprouts</b>, 1 tbsp oil, 1/4 teaspoon <b>salt</b>, and 1/8 tsp <b>pepper</b> on rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Toss <b>squash</b>, 1 tbsp oil, 1/4 tsp salt, and remaining jerk seasoning on another rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roast vegetables until lightly browned, stirring and rotating pans between racks halfway through for about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add <b>shallot</b> and cook, stirring until softened for about 2 mins.</li>
            <li>Add <b>broth</b> and bring to a boil. Add <b>quinoa</b>, cover and reduce heat to a low simmer.</li>
            <li>Cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed for 15-20 mins. Then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>When the vegetables are out of the oven, turn broiler to high and line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
            <li>Place the salmon skin-side up, on the prepared baking sheet. Broil until the skin is crispy and the flesh is opaque for 8-10 mins.</li>
            <li>Whisk <b>mango juice/nectar</b>, <b>cilantro</b>, remaining oil, 3 tsp lime juice, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/8 tsp pepper in a small bowl.</li>
